# CSE-155
Project for CSE 155 - Human Computer Interaction

We want to make an app that can take an image of a block of text, whether it be typed or handwritten, and for that text to be translated into your language of choice. This idea spawned when we saw that most translation apps don’t have this feature. We plan to test the efficiency of our app by testing different lengths of texts, different fonts, and different font sizes. We also want to make our app user friendly by making the interface as simple as possible. Ideally, it will work similarly to google lens, although, we don’t know if we will be able to accomplish this.
